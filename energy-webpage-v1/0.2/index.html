            <h2>Understanding Energy Consumption in Australia</h2>
            <p>Australian households use an average of 18-20 kWh of electricity per day. With rising energy costs and environmental concerns, choosing energy-efficient appliances has never been more important.</p>
            <p>The Energy Rating Label helps you compare the energy efficiency of appliances. More stars mean better efficiency and lower running costs. A typical Australian household can save hundreds of dollars annually by choosing appliances with higher star ratings.</p>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>Why Energy Efficiency Matters</h2>
            <p>Energy-efficient appliances reduce your electricity bills, lower your carbon footprint, and contribute to a more sustainable future for Australia. With electricity prices continuing to rise, the savings from efficient appliances compound over time.</p>
            <p>The Australian government's Energy Rating scheme provides standardized information to help consumers make informed decisions about appliance purchases.</p>

            <h2>Tips for Reducing TV Energy Consumption</h2>
            <p>• Turn off your TV when not in use rather than leaving it on standby</p>
            <p>• Reduce screen brightness to comfortable levels</p>
            <p>• Enable power-saving modes available in most modern TVs</p>
            <p>• Consider screen size carefully - larger screens use more energy</p>
            <p>• Look for TVs with high energy star ratings when purchasing</p>
